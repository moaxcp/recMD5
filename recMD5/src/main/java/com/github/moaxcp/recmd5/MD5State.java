/**
 * recoverable md5
 * <p>
 * This library is a rewrite of the fast-md5 implementation in java. The goal of
 * this library is to make the MD5 state recoverable for cases where the programmer
 * does not want to recalculate an MD5 for partial hashes of files or streams.
 * It is not meant to be fast and does not use the native code, although, it
 * would be easy for a programmer to implement the native code.
 * <p>
 * Fast implementation of RSA's MD5 hash generator in Java JDK Beta-2 or higher<br>
 * Originally written by Santeri Paavolainen, Helsinki Finland 1996 <br>
 * (c) Santeri Paavolainen, Helsinki Finland 1996 <br>
 * Some changes Copyright (c) 2002 Timothy W Macinta <br>
 * Updates to use MessageDigest abstraction and to allow the internal state to
 * be recoverable in case of crash 2011 John Mercier<br>
